AIM : INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

THEORY:
Python is a user-friendly and easy-to-learn programming language used for general-purpose programming. It is widely used because of its simple syntax and readability.

1. The basic syntax of Python is studied by assigning multiple values to variables in a single line and displaying them using the print() function.

2. The sep parameter is used to print each value on a new line.

3. The experiment explains different data types such as int, float, str, and bool.

4. The type() function is used to identify the data type of each variable.

5. Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation are performed using Python operators to understand basic calculations.

6. Python also allows taking input from the user using the input() function. Since input is taken as a string, typecasting is used to convert it into integer or float values before performing calculations.

7. The math module is used to perform mathematical operations. Functions such as math.pi and math.log() are used to calculate the area of a circle and logarithmic values.

8. Decision-making statements are introduced using if-else. Two numbers are compared, and based on the condition, the program prints which number is greater.

CONCLUSION:
From this experiment, it can be concluded that Python is an easy and user-friendly programming language that helps beginners understand programming concepts clearly.
The experiment provided practical knowledge of basic Python syntax, data types, arithmetic operations, user input, and the use of the math module.
It also helped in understanding how conditional statements like if-else are used for decision-making in programs.
